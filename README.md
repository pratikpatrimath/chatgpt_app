I have created chatgpt application using chatgpt api in flutter and Ihave used provider state managment
Provider is a popular state management solution for Flutter, which helps manage and share data between widgets efficiently. It's an open-source package that simplifies the process of passing data and managing the state of your Flutter application. Provider is commonly used to implement the "Provider pattern" and can be seen as a replacement for older state management solutions like InheritedWidget.
